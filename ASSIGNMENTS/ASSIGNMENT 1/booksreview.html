                        This book by Robert Greene is, without a doubt, one of the very worst books I’ve ever read. It is ghastly on multiple levels.

                I do try to read an eclectic range of books and push myself to read recommended books I wouldn’t normally bother with. I can’t recall is ‘The 48 Laws of Power’ was recommended to me, or if it just kept coming up on social media, or if I just came across it and thought “why not?” I can imagine it might just have been the latter as, with my psychologist’s hat on, it is just about in my line of interest and I certainly read it hoping I would get some insights into how people tick which might be useful. I was disappointed.
                
                Instead, I got to see the very worst of human nature – something I can get more than my fill of just by going on Twitter and reading the myriad right-wing comments I see every time. Worse than that (for with my historian’s hat on, you see the worst and most stupid of humanity on a regular basis and so it is no big deal) Greene writes absolute rubbish and passes it off as fact. That’s unforgivable.
                
                These 48 ‘laws’ are nothing of the sort. They are a mix up of opinions and weird interpretations of stories and alleged moments of history which bear little resemblance to real life. Indeed, Greene’s tortured view of historical events is so bad that my History students would easily see the faults. His versions of Tudor history, for instance, are, at best, simplistic and, at worst, absolute fiction. Similarly, from ancient history to modern, Russian, Chinese, British, American or European, he shows again and again that he’s read a history book once and twisted every moment he can to fit his ideas. It’s like reading tales of history taken straight out of the British Empire era.
                
                What is blatantly missing is any psychological evidence or indeed the use of any science at all, and that is telling. Greene twists history and resorts to myths and children’s tales to exemplify his points. There’s zero definitive truth in this book.
                
                But perhaps worst of all is the moral vacuity of the book. You can forgive books such as Dale Carnegie’s classic “How to Win Friends and Influence People” – which also don’t use scientific evidence – for their simple moral value. Carnegie writes to help you get on better with your fellow humans and live and peace and mutual prosperity. He uses stories from real life from which you can see understandable and realistic principles, easily be applied to your own life to see if they work or not (and on the whole, they do). Conversely, Greene’s ‘laws’ sound grand but are actually vague and impractical. And, ultimately, every single one is self-seeking and to the detriment of those around you and with whom you interact.
                
                Written at the end of the 90s, I think – if not, truly hope – that this book is a product of its time. I seem to recall there was a lot of such books on the market back then offering the gullible reader ways to get ahead of the pack, to beat the rat race, get the promotion, improve your inner skills and so on. My feeling is that these kinds of books have died out over the last ten to fifteen years. Perhaps this is because of the internet and all that can be accessed with the web? Life is simpler in many ways now with young people entering into minimalist lifestyles so much more easily than my generation did. With a smart TV, phone, perhaps game station or laptop, there’s very little more needed for a comfortable capitalist lifestyle. Income, after paying bills, can be spent on those optional luxuries – clothes, holidays, cosmetics, drink or fine food. Of course, many are ditching even this kind of luxurious living going for even simpler lifestyles.
                
                And the fact is, this is all acceptable now. No one judges their neighbours’ way of living because we live in societies (in the West, at least) where individuality is encouraged. Vive la difference! But what we all feel we have now as a result, is power. This power is the power to live how we wish to, rather than power to dominate. To have enough money to spend on the simple pleasures that everything else that may be bad in the world seems nought. Such living can lead to apathy, of course, and I would say the UK political climate at the moment is directly a result of such high-living apathy, but the craving for power at the expense of another is much less than in previous decades.
                
                And this is a good thing, I think. Let the dinosaurs of Greene and his like be confined to the fossil collection of history. Those who view humanity as a battle to be won, with victors and losers, and all around potential enemies to be controlled and used for gain. Be gone, such foul creatures! You are not welcome any longer. And if you must, must be there at all – at least get your facts right and present proper evidence<br>

                    </p><p>Atomic Habits by James Clear is a comprehensive, practical guide on how to change your
                        habits and get 1% better every day. Using a framework called the Four Laws of Behavior Change, Atomic Habits
                        teaches readers a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones. Read the full summary
                        to glean 3 key lessons from Atomic Habits, learn how to build a habit in 4 simple steps, and get a handy
                        reference guide for the strategies recommended throughout the book.If you find yourself struggling to build
                        a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It’s often because
                        you’ve not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite
                        working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to
                        thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted, it’s just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two
                        degrees.Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those
                        results.
            
                        The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game
                        staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of
                        three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The same is true for other areas
                        of life.
            
                        If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
            
                        Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems
                        arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.
            
                        A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the
                        product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your
                        system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first
                        envision.
            
                        The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the
                        game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about
                        the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process
                        that will determine your progressOur habits should be a part of our identity and the starting point of
                        building it. Most of us get this wrong – we start with outcomes and work backwards towards our identity. But
                        when a habit comes from who we are, it serves as the best form of intrinsic motivation.
            
                        For example, I had to change my thinking regarding eating healthy. Before reading Atomic Habits I was
                        thinking that if I want to reduce my belly fat, I must follow Tim Ferriss’ Slow Carb diet which will make me
                        a healthy person (outcome -&gt; identity).
            
                        But a correct identity-based approach would be for me to think that I’m a healthy person therefore, as a
                        healthy person, I’ll eat wholesome food and exercise regularly which will then lead to reduced belly fat
                        (identity -&gt; outcome).
            
                        Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be
                        skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).”
            
                        They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the
                        beliefs that drive their actions.
            
                        They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realise that their old identity can
                        sabotage their new plans for change. Behind every system of actions is a system of beliefs

                        In Think Like a Monk, Jay Shetty guides us through a transformational journey showing how we can adopt the peaceful mindset and centered lifestyle of monks. He introduces us to the concept of Dharma, a Buddhist principle that everyone has a personal duty, vocation, or calling. To live a meaningful life, he teaches us to identify and fulfill our unique Dharma.

                        Shetty emphasises the importance of mindfulness, a practice deeply ingrained in monk culture. As we delve deeper, we learn the significance of a clear and present mind in attaining tranquility and balance in our lives. In saying so, he encourages us to replace overthinking and stress with periods of silence, meditation, and self-reflection.Shetty next discusses detachment, explaining how it can bring us not only peace but also greater, more meaningful connections with one another. By detaching ourselves from material possessions, people's opinions, and our own egos, we can focus on what's genuinely important. Shetty asks us to see others for who they truly are, rather than our preconceived notions about them, urging us to empathise instead of judge.
            
                        Perception is another key theme in Think Like a Monk. Shetty discusses how our individual perceptions of reality shape our responses to the world around us. He illustrates how our mindset and the lens through which we view the world can turn problems into opportunities, fear into courage, and failures into stepping stones for success.Diving deeper, Shetty guides us to discover our true passions and purposes in life. He encourages us to explore the link between our talents, passion, and the impact we can make in society. Referring to his own journey, Shetty shares how we can turn our passion into a purpose that's larger than ourselves.
            
                        In his view, true success lies in serving others and making a positive impact. He elaborates on how we can maintain service as our focal point to navigate the journey of life with higher gratification and fulfillment. Indeed, Shetty's personal story acts as an exemplary of finding "Ikigai," the Japanese concept of "reason for being," melding passion and purpose.In the final lesson from Think Like a Monk, Shetty conveys the importance of self-discipline and resilience. He teaches us to harness monk-like discipline to battle challenges and view them as opportunities for growth. This, coupled with meditation and mindfulness practices, equips us with an unshakeable resilience that monks are renowned for.
            
                        In conclusion, Think Like a Monk invites us to imbibe the wisdom of monks to lead lives filled with peace, purpose, and happiness. The book is a treasure trove of timeless wisdom that inspires us to cultivate a monk-like mindset and achieve an enlightened, fulfilled state of being in our everyday urban lives.
